## 🌍 Project Overview

**LifeArch** is a digital unessay project that explores how media, storytelling, and visual presentation can influence public empathy toward endangered species—specifically the **African Forest Elephant**.

Rather than presenting this research in a traditional essay format, this project uses a **website** as its medium, allowing the reader to engage with conservation issues through narrative structure, design, and accessible language.

## 🎯 Purpose & Central Question

This project asks:

> *How can media and digital storytelling shift public perception from passive sympathy to active responsibility toward wildlife conservation?*

LifeArch aims to:
- Raise awareness about the ivory trade and habitat loss  
- Humanize conservation through storytelling  
- Encourage ethical reflection and advocacy

## 🖥️ Medium Choice: Why a Website?

The website format was intentionally chosen to:
- Reflect how modern audiences consume information  
- Combine **text, layout, and visual pacing** to shape emotion  
- Create a non-linear reading experience unlike a standard essay  

This aligns with the goals of an **unessay**, where form and content work together to communicate meaning.

## 🧩 Project Structure

The website includes:
- An informational narrative on elephant conservation  
- Calls to action (education, advocacy, ethical consumption)  
- A clean, minimal layout to keep focus on the message  
- A footer identifying authorship and ownership of the work
