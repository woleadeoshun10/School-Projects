Santiago straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and heads home, 
thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the market 
and how many people he will feed. 
On his way in to shore, sharks are attracted to the marlin's blood. 
Santiago kills a great mako shark with his harpoon, 
but he loses the weapon. 
He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife 
to the end of an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; 
five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. 
But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall 
the sharks have almost devoured the marlin's entire carcass, 
leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail, 
and its head. Santiago knows that he is destroyed and 
tells the sharks of how they have killed his dreams.
